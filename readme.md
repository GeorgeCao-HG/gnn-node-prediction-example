# Basic GNN for Node-Level Prediction

This project provides a self-contained, runnable example of a Graph Neural Network (GNN) for a node-level prediction task, built using PyTorch and PyTorch Geometric.

The goal is to demonstrate the end-to-end process of:
1. Defining a GNN architecture.
2. Generating a synthetic dataset of graphs.
3. Training the model on this dataset.
4. Evaluating the model's performance.

This code is intended as a practical learning tool for understanding the fundamentals of GNNs in a system design context.

## Features

* **GNN Model:** A simple GNN model with two `GCNConv` layers, designed for predicting features at each node of a graph.
* **Synthetic Data Generation:** Includes a function to create a dummy dataset of random graphs, making the project runnable out-of-the-box without needing external data.
* **Training & Evaluation Loop:** A standard PyTorch training loop demonstrates how to feed graph data to the model, calculate loss, and update weights.
* **Clear & Commented Code:** The code is extensively commented to explain each step of the process, from data preparation to model inference.

## Requirements

To run this project, you will need Python 3.7+ and the following libraries:
* `torch`
* `torch_geometric`

You can install PyTorch Geometric by following the official instructions on their website, which will ensure compatibility with your system's PyTorch and CUDA versions. A typical installation might look like this:

```bash
# Example installation - check PyTorch Geometric website for your specific system
pip install torch
pip install torch_geometric
````

## How to Run

1.  **Clone the repository** or save the `main.py` file to your local machine.
2.  **Install the required libraries** as described above.
3.  **Run the script** from your terminal:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

The script will automatically generate the data, build the model, train it for a set number of epochs, and print the training and test loss at each epoch.

## Code Explanation

### Data

The script generates a synthetic dataset where the task is to predict a 4-dimensional output vector for each node. The input features for each node are random, and the target `y` values are generated by applying a simple transformation to the input features, giving the model a pattern to learn.

### Model Architecture (`MyGNNModel`)

The model consists of two `GCNConv` layers.

1.  The first layer transforms the initial node features into a richer, hidden representation.
2.  The second layer refines these representations further by passing information between nodes a second time.
3.  A final `Linear` layer acts as a prediction head, mapping the final node embeddings to the desired 4-dimensional output for each node.

This architecture is effective for tasks where the prediction for a node depends on the features of its local neighborhood (in this case, nodes up to 2 "hops" away).
